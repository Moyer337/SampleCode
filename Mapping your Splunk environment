`comment("Now that you have a basic mapping, and based on your given role, you should also look for the Add-ons your organization already
has installed and configured. Odds are that you have at least a dozen tools to work with. There should be one for your HIDS, NIDS, Firewall,
and if you're really lucky, there might be a tool for your CMDB and ticketing system. Some of these will most likely require an 
individual API key if your org sets up individual accounts for accessing various tools. Gigamon/ThreatINSIGHT has an individual API key
required for you so that you can develop and maintain your own detections and queries before deploying them to your org as a whole. 
VirusTotal has an API that would be used by your org as a whole. Same thing for CB Defense. Please refer to the documentation of your 
various Add-ons or your org's documentation on what steps you as a new user would need to take to ready the various Splunk tools for use.")`

`comment("Now that you have a general understanding of your overall environment, I would sugggest you take a look at what dashboards and
reports your org already has published. These should give you some insight as to what the org has focused on in the past, and what their
folks may want to improve upon now that you're here. You can also view the source code of a given dashboard or report by hovering your
mouse over the bottom-right corner of a given panel, look for the magnifying glass and choose to run the query in a different tab. This
will show you how sophisticated and mature your org is with Splunk at the moment. While reviewing the code, take note of a few things: 
do the reports/dashboards make use of macros, lookups, CSV files or add-on commands. VirusTotal (VT), when installed AND configured, allows 
users to utilize the | virustotal command to pass hashes to the VT API and return threat scores, first time seen, last seen, and other 
useful bits of information. If your organization is still writing all code from scratch in every report and dashboard, this can be a quick 
way to set yourself apart from your peers. Look for reused code, polish it up, make it into a macro. Clone an existing dashboard, plug in 
your macro and see what needs to be changed in the overall dashboard to keep it working. This can help streamline production of new 
resources for Splunk users, while giving you some time to familiarize yourself with what your team needs to be further developed. After a 
while, do the same with lookups. If you're screening out the same values or tables frequently, put them into a lookup and save everyone 
some time and hassle.")`
